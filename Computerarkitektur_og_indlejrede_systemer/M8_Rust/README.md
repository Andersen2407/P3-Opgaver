**Exercises**:  
**1. Based on your previous buying and selling book code - create a signal alarm that triggers the buying of a book every 5 second, and the selling of a book every 10 second.**  
    - It is free of choice if you wish to do this with your thread or process based code (We are using process based).  
    - Add code that when pressing ctrl-c, you ensure a proper shutdown of all threads and memory you have used.  
     
  `$ cd ../M8/signal_market` - Go into the directory  
  `$ make` - to compile all files  
  Open three terminals, one to run each c file, run in following order.  
  `$ ./Market`  
  `$ ./SignalSeller`  
  `$ ./SignalBuyer`   
  Note: Market can max have 10 books at any time.  

  **2. Write the guessing game in rust**    
    - Write code in C which does the same thing  
    - Try out both type of code â€“ what are the differences (if any)?  

  Rust code:  
   `$ cd ../M8/guessing_game` - Go into the directory  
   `$ cargo run` - run code  

  C code  
   `$ cd ../M8` - Go into the directory 
   `$ gcc GuessingGameC.c -o GuessingGameC` - compile code  
   `$ ./GussingGameC ` - run code  

   Differences: 
   - Exception handling is worse in C, compared to Rust.  
   - Memory used:  
        5.8M	Nov  6 09:36 M8/guessing_game/target/debug/guessing_game  
        16K	Nov  6 09:31 M8/guessingGameC  

        Optimized: (using `$ cargo --release`)  
        4.5M Nov  6 09:39 M8/guessingGameC/target/release/guessing_game
