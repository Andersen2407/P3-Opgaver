**Exercises:** 
  1. Write a program in C that uses malloc() to allocate some memory  
      - Attempt to vary the amount of memory that you allocate throughout the questions  
        `AllocateMemory.c`-  Allocates increasingly large amounts of bytes.
          
      - You can use e.g. pmap PID to analyze memory usage (Linux)
        ![PID](/images/PID_Analyzes)

      - What happens if you attempt to access free’d memory?
      - If you use flags –x, -X and –XX with pmap pid, what additional information can you get?
